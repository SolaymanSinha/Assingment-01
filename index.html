      <h1>How to Become a Programmer</h1>
      <p>
        Some will say, watch YouTube tutorials. Others might say, read those
        books. Someone else may say, read blogs on that website. I say, there
        is no perfect way to learn. Whatever anyone recommends, check it out.
        If you like it, continue. If you don’t like it, Google it or search on
        YouTube or any mobile app store and find other ways to learn. Once you
        have tried out multiple ways for a few weeks, you will find out your
        own way to learn. So, don’t try to fit hard on other’s way, instead,
        build your own way to learn. That way, you will learn better!
